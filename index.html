          Our existence addresses the challenge of hours of stressfull shoping for clothes that we all no longer need to go through by; <br>
1. Colourfully displaying a variety of options of clothing both from ideas from the mind of the creators and from feedback from the customers on your social media feed.<br>

2. Secondly, we achieve this goal by delivering the purchased order to your location through a variety of courier services that we have outsourced for efficient delivery of orders.<br>
<br>
The urban Bro zm brings your weekly shopping experience to the comfort of your home. 
<br>
We help you smartly use your resorces by avoiding spending unecessary costs on fuel and or transportation by bringing your order to the door step of your home.<br> 
Our purpose is to bridge the gap between your urban clothing producers/suppliers and you.
