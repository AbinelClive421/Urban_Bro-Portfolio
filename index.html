  <p>
The Urban Bro zm is your one stop thrift store! 
Our priority is;
<br>
To promote easy access to a diverse field of urban thrift that will have you looking fresh both for basketball practice and for your drip (urban style) in those university hallways and that weekend picnic with the gang.
<br>
The Urban Bro zm addresses the challenge of hours of stressfull shoping for clothes by;
<br>
1. Colourfully displaying a variety of options of clothing both from ideas from the mind of the creators and from feedback from the customers on your social media feed.
<br>
2. By delivering the purchased order to your location through a variety of courier services that we have outsourced for efficient delivery of orders.
<br>
The urban Bro zm brings your weekly shopping experience to the comfort of your home. 
We help you smartly use your resorces by avoiding spending unecessary costs on fuel and or transportation by bringing your order to the door step of your home.
Our purpose is to bridge the gap between your urban clothing producers/suppliers and you.
